## Introduction

**EasyFL** is an easy-to-use federated learning (FL) platform based on PyTorch. It aims to enable users with various levels of expertise to experiment and prototype FL applications with little/no coding. 

You can use it for:
* FL Research on algorithm and system
* Proof-of-concept (POC) of new FL applications
* Prototype of industrial applications
* Learning FL implementations

We currently focus on horizontal FL, supporting both cross-silo and cross-device FL. You can learn more about federated learning from these [resources](https://github.com/weimingwill/awesome-federated-learning#blogs). 

## Major Features

**Easy to Start**

EasyFL is easy to install and easy to learn. It does not have complex dependency requirements. You can run EasyFL on your personal computer with only three lines of code ([Quick Start](docs/en/quick_run.md)).

**Out-of-the-box Functionalities**

EasyFL provides many out-of-the-box functionalities, including datasets, models, and FL algorithms. With simple configurations, you simulate different FL scenarios using the popular datasets. We support both statistical heterogeneity simulation and system heterogeneity simulation.

**Flexible, Customizable, and Reproducible**

EasyFL is flexible to be customized according to your needs. You can easily migrate existing CV or NLP applications into the federated manner by writing the PyTorch codes that you are most familiar with. 

**Multiple Training Modes**

EasyFL supports **standalone training**, **distributed training**, and **remote training**. By developing the code once, you can easily speed up FL training with distributed training on multiple GPUs. Besides, you can even deploy it to Kubernetes with Docker using remote training.

## Getting Started

You can refer to [Get Started](docs/en/get_started.md) for installation and [Quick Run](docs/en/quick_run.md) for the simplest way of using EasyFL.

For more advanced usage, we provide a list of tutorials on:
* [High-level APIs](docs/en/tutorials/high-level_apis.md)
* [Configurations](docs/en/tutorials/config.md)
* [Datasets](docs/en/tutorials/dataset.md)
* [Models](docs/en/tutorials/model.md)
* [Customize Server and Client](docs/en/tutorials/customize_server_and_client.md)
* [Distributed Training](docs/en/tutorials/distributed_training.md)
* [Remote Training](docs/en/tutorials/remote_training.md)
